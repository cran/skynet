# Overview

The rationale behind Skynet, is to provide researchers with a unifying
tool overcoming some of the challenges faced when dealing with the
Bureau of Transport Statistics, DB1B and T100 data. The DB1B data
consists of 2 sets of files, Coupon and Ticket. They can be both
downloaded at
<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=289> and
<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=272>
respectively while the T100 data can be found here
<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=111>.

## Note

To comply with R syntax guidelines, we changed to a clearer function
naming from version 1.2.0. Deprecated functions are still present, but
will be removed for the next versions.

## Installation

You can install skynet from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FilipeamTeixeira/skynet")
```

## Import Data

To import data, simply type `import_db1b()` or `import_t100()` including
the path to your desired file.  
**Note**: The Coupon file should take the first argument while the
Ticket file should take the second argument.

``` r
 library(skynet)
 import_db1b("folder/Coupon 2016Q1.csv", "folder/Ticket 2016Q1.csv")
 import_t100("folder/T100_2016.csv")
```

The BTS DB1B data consists of 2 sets of files, `Coupon` and `Ticket`.
They can be both downloaded at
<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=289> and
<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=272>
respectively.

Despite being possible to download the complete zipped file, which
includes all variables, due to its size, we recommend selecting the
following set.

| Coupon                     | Ticket             |
| :------------------------- | :----------------- |
| Itinerary ID               | Itinerary ID       |
| Market ID                  | Roundtrip          |
| Sequence Number            | Itinerary Yield    |
| Origin City Market ID      | Passengers         |
| Origin                     | Itinerary Fare     |
| Year                       | Bulkfare Indicator |
| Quarter                    | Distance           |
| Destination City Market ID |                    |
| Destination                |                    |
| Trip Break                 |                    |
| Operating Carrier          |                    |
| Distance                   |                    |
| Gateway                    |                    |

Since version 1.0.2 that the import method changed being the
`netimport()` function no longer available. When importing from the
prezipped DB1B file, just add the argument `zip = TRUE` to the
`import_db1b()` function. This does not apply to the T100 file which can
be simply imported by typing `import_t100()`. In order to save space, it
is possible as well to import the prezipped file, and convert it to a
smaller file with only the necessary variables, with the function
`convert_raw()`.

## Example

To generate a directed network, please type:

    library(skynet)
    # For DB1B data
    import_db1b("folder/Coupon_2011Q1.csv", "folder/Ticket_2011Q1.csv")
    make_net_dir(OD_2011Q1, disp = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
    
    # For T100 data
    import_t100("folder/T100_2011.csv")
    make_net_dir(T100_2011Q1, disp = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
